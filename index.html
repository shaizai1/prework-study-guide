        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li>At the very top, we see the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. </li>
     <li>Next, we see the <html> opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. Inside the <html> tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English). An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>Our default branch is called main, but master may also be seen in older repos. We shouldn’t do any coding directly in the main branch. Instead, we will branch off of main and create a feature branch, which is a copy of the main branch. That way, we maintain the main branch and we can track the changes that were made to it via the feature branches. </li>
    <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app!</li>
    <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch.</li>
    <li>The base branch is where the changes will be merged into, in our case the default branch, main.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
