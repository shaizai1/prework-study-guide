# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student, it is important for the course prework notes to be organised and structured on a webpage. This way, the information can be easily accessed and revised. By creating this project, I have organised my notes alongside practicing the content I am studying.
This makes it much easier to contain all the new information in a meaningful way.
-Along the way I have learned how to practically apply the concepts I have been studying.


## Usage

The study guide can be used by navigating the different sections to learn about the following topics:
HTML
CSS
Git
JavaScript
For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
